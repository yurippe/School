;;;; Exercise 27 / Summary
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;Terry Lambert is demonstrating that claiming to have mastered anything is a pretty big
;claim, and that "knowing that you don't actually know everything" is important.
;He thinks that to appeal to other people, one must show humility and willingness to learn,
;rather than claiming to know everything.

;My reply:
;"""
;It is great that you feel confident about your abilities as  programmer, however
;, if you want to appeal to people you should consider not telling anyone that you are
;a programmer, let alone a good one, as most *normal* people consider programmers nerds
;or losers. :(
;
;TL;DR:
;if (you.isAProgrammer):
;   if(! you.talkAbout(somethingElse)):
;      otherPeople.willConsiderAsLoser(you)
