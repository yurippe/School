;;Exercise 64 Summary
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;a)

;Mathematicians can be subdivided into two types: the problem solvers and
;the theorizers. The problem solver likes to take on very difficult challenges
;and solve them, but once solved, he has no interest in it anymore.
;The theorizers likes to find ways to trivialize mathematics. They want to
;perfect current solutions, and they only care about definitions.

;b)

;I would say this applies to computer scientists, as either you like to implement
;or you like to design algorithms. At least to the same degree Rota thinks of it.

;c)

;It is 1:22 am and I can't think of any ;)
